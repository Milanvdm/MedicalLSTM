I start with expressing my gratitude towards Roel for giving me the opportunity to work on a truly interesting subject. I also appreciate that you were not just an invisible promoter, but a promoter who showed a true interest in the subject and curiosity for the results of the research. \\
I also know that I am a lucky student who fell with his "butt in the butter" as Ellie took the time and effort to proofread my thesis a couple of times. Together with Roel, you really provided me with a lot of support and made it possible to finish my thesis in a way I'm proud of. Thank you. \\
On a  more personal note, I want to thank the people who stood by my side. My parents who gave me the opportunities in life and also prepared me for those opportunities. My friends, the CW kneusjes, my kotgenoten, and of course Siemen, the guy who somehow still manages to stay around. I also want to thank my future wife, just to cover all bases. \\

\begin{abstract}

In today's medical world, more and more data is stored using Electronic Health Records. Each time a patient goes to a hospital, doctor or receives lab results, those events are stored in the patient's Electronic Health Record (EHR). The medical world and governments are interested in EHRs as they can for example provide new insights into disease trajectories, drug treatments, medical costs, or the link between demographics and certain diseases. \\

Due to the increased use of EHRs, a new research area has emerged, namely the area of Electronic Health Record Analytics. EHR analytics is an active research field as a lot of different problems need to be solved. At the moment various research groups are working on utilizing EHRs to find medical patterns with several methods like querying, statistics, data mining, and artificial intelligence approaches. \\
In the field of machine learning algorithms, a limited amount of research is done on EHRs, mainly using out-of-the box tools. \\
The focus point of this thesis is: applying advanced machine learning algorithms to find patterns in EHRs. \\

An EHR of a patient can be seen as a time series, namely a sequence of EHR events such as visits to the doctor. In this thesis we make the analogy between sentences of words and sequences of EHR events. Based on this analogy, we propose novel techniques which are generalizations of the Word2Vec approach, a technique typically used in linguistic analysis. \\
We call this approach a generalized Word2Vec approach and it can be applied on medical data to find the correlations between different diagnoses. \\
To make sure the generalized Word2Vec methods can be applied to large-scale medical data, we applied the generalization concept also on DeepWalk. DeepWalk makes it possible to generate a smaller dataset from the original dataset and then apply a Word2Vec approach on this smaller dataset. \\
Besides the exploration on generalizing Word2Vec approaches, we also improve Word2Vec by tackling one of its shortcomings. This shortcoming of Word2Vec is that it is unable to handle unseen instances once the model has been built. We combine a k-nearest neighbors method with Word2Vec and make an estimation of the correlation to other diagnoses for the unseen instance. \\

To enable this, we use several preprocessing methods. One of these methods is a newly proposed disease code mapping between two standards namely MedDRA and ICD-10. This mapping is used to categorize diagnoses and to make our validation process possible. With this categorization of the data we enable more general EHR events during training. \\

We explain how we build a model of our proposed methods. We introduce the OSIM2 dataset on which we train a model using our generalized Word2Vec, knn Word2Vec, and generalized DeepWalk. The OSIM2 dataset is a simulated dataset generated by an organization named OMOP. To make it possible to apply our methods on the OSIM2 dataset, we use the above mentioned disease code mapping. \\

After building the model, we execute two different experiments by generating clusters based on our model. The reason behind the clusters is that we can compare those clusters to the results of the currently largest study on Danish EHRs. We quantify this comparison using a matching percentage.  \\
We check the influence of a parameter on the matching percentage by inspecting $504$ parameter settings. From all these parameter settings, we deduce general trends. \\
After checking the individual parameters, we take the parameter setting with the highest average matching percentage for each approach and compare the different approaches. \\

The results from both experiments are that each approach has a maximum matching percentage of $60$\%. It is still difficult to quantify how well a match is of around $60$\% but we conclude this is good enough to show the potential of our approaches. \\

We conclude that both our knn Word2Vec and DeepWalk have the same performance as the basic generalized Word2Vec. This means that we can handle unseen EHR events and train our model on $50$\% of the dataset size using DeepWalk without losing accuracy. \\
Within the limitations of our validation method, we conclude that our models do match the Danish results well depending on the experiment. Especially since we use several estimations such as the disease code mapping, different datasets, and categorization.
