- Introduction
	
- Background: write about machine learning, time series, neural networks, backpropagation

- Context: Depends on chosen problem (ex. Prediction of Disease Progression | Word Embedding)
	
	Explain Disease codes
	Explain Danish paper
	Explain Word2Vec
	=> Conclude to a problem/gap that needs to be solved

	Review current literature 
	=> Explain in general on how we are going to solve the problem

- General Word2Vec Approach

	Explain the method used
	Explain Tsne
	Explain generalization

- DeepWalk

	Explain deepwalk
	Explain why


- Software tools

	TensorFlow
	DL4J

- Experiments

	Set up
	Chosen parameters
	What we are validating
	
	Part about Word2Vec experiments to Danish paper
	Part about DeepWalk experiments to complete dataset

	Results

- Discussion

	Why does it work/not work


- Conclusion


- Future work
